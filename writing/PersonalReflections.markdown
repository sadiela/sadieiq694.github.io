##Personal

The Beaver Works Summer Institute proved to be an invaluable experience for me. I learned more than I could have ever imagined: about communication, about the future and about myself.

Before this program, I neither enjoyed group work nor appreciated its value. For the most part I viewed team projects as a nuisance and did not value the input of fellow group members. I learned a lot about how to be successful when working with others.
In terms of working as a team:
One thing from the communications lectures that resonated with me
Building trust through vulnerability
Super chickens (ask for Ted talk name/stuff)
In terms of how i think about myself
Gained confidence in abilities
At the same time, humbled; there is always someone you can learn from, and that’s not a bad thing
In terms of my future
This program will definitely be influential in decisions I make (both for college and for what major I choose)
The guest lectures exposed us to a myriad of different careers in STEM field
I realize now that many STEM degrees are highly versatile and that your major does not define your career path
The biomimetics particularly interested me because I am passionate about biology and robotics/engineering, and it is a really cool niche where people get to work with both fields
In short, this program alleviated a lot of my stress in terms of  “choosing”

##Program

Thoughts on program improvement
I have very little to say in terms of how this program could be improved. The one thing that I think the program directors and instructors should consider is keeping the teams the same throughout all four weeks. One thing that Ms. Connor
Keep teams the same throughout the program
This is not the fault of the program whatsoever, but during week 3 there was very little structure for a vast majority of lab time. This was because there were difficulties with getting the localization and mapping packages working, but just as a general rule, more structure is better. Less time is wasted when everyone knows exactly what they are supposed to do
